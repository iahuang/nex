# Hello, World!
"Hello, world!" refers to a class of computer program generally used as a minimum working example
of a computer programming language. The behavior of the "Hello, world!" program is largely
the same across implementations; the string "Hello, world!" is written to stdout, and the program
then terminates.

## Example implementation in C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(char* argv) {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
