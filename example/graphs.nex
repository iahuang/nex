## Definitions

#callout {
    :title Definition (Graph)

    A **graph** is a pair of sets $(V,E)$ which are defined as follows:
    #ul {
        - !V is a set of objects. Each element !V is called a *vertex* of the graph, and !V itself is called the set of *vertices* of the graph.
        - !E is a set of pairs of objects from !V where each pair $\pair{v_1, v_2}$ is a set consisting of two distinct vertices and is called an *edge* of the graph. Order does not matter, that is, $\{v_1,v_@\}\equiv \{v_2,v_1\}$.
    }
}

### Example

#diagram {
    :width 50%
    :position centered

    #graph {
        A B
        C D

        A->B
        A->D
        A->C
        B->C
        D->C
    }
}
The above graph would be denoted $G=(V,E)$ where
$$
    V=\{A,B,C,D\}
$$
and
$$
    E=\{\{A,B\},\{A,D\},\{A,C\},\{B,C\},\{D,C\}\}
$$

#callout {
    :title Definition (Adjacency)

    Let $G=(V,E)$.

    Let $v_1,v_@\in V$.
    
    !v_1 and !v_2 are called **adjacent** if and only if there exists
    $$
        \{v_1,v_2\}\in E.
    $$

## First Isomorphism Theorem

*From Wikipedia:*

In the left diagram, which expresses the first isomorphism theorem, commutativity of the triangle means that $f=\overbar{f}\circ\pi$. In the right diagram, commutativity of the square means $h\circ f=k\circ g$.

#diagram {
    #graph {
        G H
        gk
        
        gk: G/\ker(f)
        G->H ^ f
        gk->H _ \overbar{f}
        G->gk _ \pi
    }
}

#diagram {
    #graph {
        A B
        C D

        A->B ^ f
        B->D ^ h
        A->C ^ C
        C->D _ k
    }
}
