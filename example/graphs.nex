## Definitions

#callout {
    :title Definition (Graph)

    A **graph** is a pair of sets $(V,E)$ which are defined as follows:
    #ul {
        - !V is a set of objects. Each element !V is called a *vertex* of the graph, and !V itself is called the set of *vertices* of the graph.
        - !E is a set of pairs of objects from !V where each pair $\{v_1,v_2\}$ is a set consisting of two distinct vertices and is called an *edge* of the graph. Order does not matter, that is, $\{v_1,v_@\}\equiv \{v_2,v_1\}$.
    }
}

### Example

#diagram {
    :width 50%
    :position centered

    #script {
        let d = new Diagram({
            bounds: new Bounds(-10, 10, -10, 10)
        });

        let bubble = (content, at) => {
            d.circle({
                at: at,
                radius: 2,
                style: {
                    fill: colors.white,
                    border: colors.black,
                    bwidth: 1
                }
            });
            d.text({
                text: content
            });
        }

        bubble("A", vec2(-2, 2));
        bubble("B", vec2(2, 2));
        bubble("C", vec2(2, -2));
        bubble("D", vec2(-2, -2));
    }
}
The above graph would be denoted $G=(V,E)$ where
$$
    V=\{A,B,C,D\}
$$
and
$$
    E=\{\{A,B\},\{A,D\},\{A,C\},\{B,C\},\{D,C\}\}
$$

#callout {
    :title Definition (Adjacency)

    Let $G=(V,E)$.

    Let $v_1,v_@\in V$.
    
    !v_1 and !v_2 are called **adjacent** if and only if there exists
    $$
        \{v_1,v_2\}\in E.
    $$
