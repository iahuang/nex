## 2.3 The Formal Definition of Limit

Recall that when we say

#m {
    lim(x -> a)f(x) = L
}

we should interpret this as "as !x approaches !a, $f(x)$ approaches !L". More specifically, "we can make $f(x)$
arbitrarily close to !L by making !x arbitrarily close to !a". Recall the earlier definition of using absolute value
for closeness. The notion of making !x arbitrarily close to !a can be thought of as writing a condition where,
for some arbitrarily small $\delta$,

#m {
    abs(x-a) < delta
}

Remember that the notion of limit does not care exactly what happens at $x = a$. Thus, the distance from !x
to !a, $|x - a|$, must also be greater than zero. Hence, we write

#m {
    0<abs(x-a)<delta
}

The other part of this interpretation says that we can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to !L by making $\delta$ arbitrarily
small. So, for some arbitrarily small $\varepsilon$, the distance between $f(x)$ and !L is less than $\varepsilon$, thus,

#m {
    abs(f(x)-L)<epsilon
}
