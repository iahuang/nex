# NeX

NeX is a markup language designed with lightweight, unobtrusive syntax in mind.

### Purpose

NeX is primarily designed for note-taking as an alternative to LaTeX. LaTeX is a valid solution for taking math-heavy notes, but it has a steep learning curve, is prone to issues that may require Googling, and has syntax that makes LaTeX code difficult to read as is. NeX aims to solve these issues by acting as a higher-level abstraction for LaTeX-like code aimed at rapid authoring of documents rather than low-level typesetting control.

## Installation

You need to have Node.js (v14 or higher) installed to run NeX. 
1. [Download](https://github.com/iahuang/nex/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repository, then `cd` to the downloaded copy of this repository and run `npm run install-nex`.
2. Run `nex -h` to confirm that the installation succeeded.
